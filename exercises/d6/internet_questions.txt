1. When you type a URL and hit enter, your browser takes the URL and sends it to the Domain Name Server (DNS). 
2. The DNS sends back the IP address associated with that URL. It essentially works like a hash, with the URL as the key and the IP address as the value.
3. The browser uses that IP address to find the server and make an HTTP request.
4. An HTTP request is the way by which servers and clients talk to each other. The request has a header (sort of like the 'metadata') and a message body (with some params)
5. The request is processed at the server, which is a computer or collection of computers that can be located anywhere in the world.
5. The server processes the HTTP request, and sends along the necessary parameters to the web application. In our case, this is Rails.
6. The web application processes the parameters and gives html code back to the server.
7. The server sends the response back to the browser, which is displayed for the user to see.

1. When we go to this address, we get a 404 error message from GitHub that "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"
2. It means that the GitHub server could not find the page that fulfilled the HTTP request
3. The error displays 404 because that is the HTTP standard response coe for such an error.
4. Ruby still rocks! We just haven't created the necessary page yet.
